          I'm a developer with a passion for creating beautiful and intuitive user experiences.<br />
          iâ€™m currently working in some projects, but i'm always looking for new challenges.<br />
          My main focus is on the back-end, but i'm also very good at the front-end, using reactJS, and .NET Forms Besides to this, I have experience in managing Linux servers (Debian based and CentOS based) and in computer networks, in addition to being a graduate as an electronic engineer from the Universidad de Falcon, in Venezuela.
